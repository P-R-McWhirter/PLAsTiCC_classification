# PLAsTiCC_classification
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python/R scripts used to achieve the Liverpool Telescope 41st placement in the Kaggle LSST (VRO) PLAsTiCC variable star and transient classification competition.

There is a bit of a jumble of well labelled and 'not-so-well-labelled (read untitledX) notebooks as I played around with the data.

The data is not included but can be downloaded from the PLAsTiCC Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018/ which also contains information and downloads for the higher performing solutions.
